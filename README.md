## Description
Note Taker is a fulfillment for UC Berkeley bootcamp for creating an Express.js back end application for viewing, creating, and deleting notes saved to a json file. The objective was to build a back end and connect it to the already created front end, and then deploy to [Heroku](https://salty-forest-11453.herokuapp.com/).
